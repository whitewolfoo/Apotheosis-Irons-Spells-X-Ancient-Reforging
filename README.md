If you are actually interested in the mods files continue, if you arent the releases should be on the right, its a bit confusing cuz idk how tags and all that work but it shouldn't be too hard to navigate, or go to curseforge

if you're interested I recommend checking out the apotheosis x iron's files too, thats what I built this mod off of, and its generally gives you a better understanding of apotheosis and the like.
